# Installation 18

http://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_Installation_18

Explore the uncharted area of twitter data mining for all CBSi brands, and aggregate the data into a statistical live dashboard.

## Setup

    cd app
    npm install
    node app.js

## History
This was written over a span of 24 hours as a "Hack Day" project at work.  The code is a bit messy, and there's much room for improvement, but at present, it's a great starting point for processing real-time data from the Twitter stream.

## Future Plans
In addition to cleaning up what exists now, we're planning to:
- make processors more dynamic, including how data is presented on the frontend
- find a good way to use inheritance to cut down on duplicate code
- expose more metrics of the data that's read in
- explore processing data from even more social networks
- and more!
